											<h3>IoT project At Tweleve Dot</h3>
											<p>During the summer of 2021, I had this amazing opportunity to do an internship at a cybersecurity company called Twelve Dot. I got to work on a project where I made an IoT device that would be used as a target to demonstrate and expose the various vulnerabilities of IoT devices when it comes to security. With the development of technology, IoT devices are being more and more used in various fields such as manufacturing, agriculture as well as the medical field. Therefore, it is important for companies like Twelve Dot to raise awareness to other professionals about the danger that comes with the use of IoT devices.  Click on the link below to learn more about the project as well as my experience at Twelve Dot.</p>

											<h3>Django Blog</h3>
											<p>As I was learning python, I also learned how to work with the famous backend framework called Django. I used it to build a blog website where any user can make articles and read the ones that are already made. All the articles are saved in an SQLite database. As you can see on the picture at the top the styles of the website look really basic due to the fact that for this project I really focused on the backend. I made some random and fake articles to test the functionality of the application. See the GitHub repository of the project down below.</p>

											<h3>Two Full Adders</h3>
											<p>In my grade 11 engineering class, I learned logic gates, which allowed me to make a two full adders circuit. After making the circuit, I made a program able to find the state of the circuit by connecting to it with the help of a Pico board. The program was made in Scratch and it was able to use the state of the circuit to do simple binary addition.</p>

											<h3>Excel Application</h3>
											<p>I built the Excel Application using python as well as the openpyxl and Panda library. The app can convert lists or datasets into excel spreadsheets. To use the app, you need to first insert a file with the list of datasets, it can be JSON, TXT, or any type of files that can be handled by the panda‚Äôs library, then once the source code is run, a new excel file is created with data in the spreadsheets. You can access the source code through my GitHub.</p>

											<h3>Mail Client Project</h3>
											<p>
												I made a mail client as part of the final networking project in my gr12 computer engineering course. The mail client was made in python and basically used the SMTP protocol to send an email through the python script. You can acess my source code through my GitHub. ü§ôüèæ

											<h3>TCP Chat Room</h3>
											<p>This project is one of my favorites! It is a chat room made with python. In this project, I used python to create a server that is constantly listening for clients to connect using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Once a client connects, the server as for a username in order to identify each connected client. When a client sends a message, it first goes to the server and then gets sent to all the connected clients including the sender. As you can see in the picture at the top how the project works. You can also access the source code through my GitHub!</p>
